hesiod for Debian
----------------------

This is the hesiod name service library, available from
ftp://athena-dist.mit.edu/pub/ATHENA/hesiod.  Hesiod is derived from BIND,
the Berkeley Internet Name Daemon, and can leverage the existing DNS
infrastructure of a network to provide name service for a variety of
applications.
